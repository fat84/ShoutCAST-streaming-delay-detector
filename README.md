# ShoutCAST-streaming-delay-detector
This repository implements a ShoutCAST streaming delay detector, using a streming recorder that will pick small sections of the streaming, to save it on mp3 format, and then analize whether this small sections contain silence or not, with pydub. It is better to use it on Python 3.6
